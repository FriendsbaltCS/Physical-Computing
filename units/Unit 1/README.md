# Unit 1

Welcome to your first unit of Physical Computing! In this unit we'll explore:

- The RaspberryPi Pico and Thonny editor
- Basic coding in Python
- First principles of electronics and circuitry

We'll use these skills to build our first physical computing projects, creating responsive machines with simple I/O devices.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1 - Getting Started

In this lesson, we'll build a simple program to blink the LED on the RaspberryPi Pico and explore the code behind it. We'll also examine the procedural Python code behind this project and introduce the CircuitPython framework.
